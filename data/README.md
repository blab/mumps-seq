## Consensus genomes 
These consensus genomes represent those generated from a mumps outbreak in Washington in 2016, in addition to a sampling of mumps genomes collected from all over the US from 2006 to present. These genomes were used in a [paper describing the mumps outbreak](https://elifesciences.org/articles/66448#content), and have also been deposited in public databases for others to use. Consensus genomes are freely available in Genbank under accession numbers [MT859507-MT859672](ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=MT859507%3AMT859672%5Baccn%5D), and raw fastq files with all human reads removed are available on the Short Read Archive under BioProject [PRJNA641715](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA641715). A key that links the strain names as shown in this repository to the bioproject accessions is available [here](). 

During the process of doing this project, we renamed strains a few times. All sequences currently here contain the strain names as used and displayed on nextstrain.org/mumps and as deposited in Genbank. However, if you accessed and used these genomes previously, we have included a [name key](https://github.com/blab/mumps-seq/blob/master/data/consensus-genomes/strain-names-key-2020-06-15.fasta) to convert between these new strain names and the ones listed previously.
