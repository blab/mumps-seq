## Overview of Illumina sequencing pipeline for mumps viruses
1. [vRNA extraction](vRNA\ extraction.md) with QiAmp vRNA mini kit (Qiagen)
2. [cDNA synthesis](RT\ and \ PCR.md) with Protoscript II First strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB)
3. [PCR](RT\ and \ PCR.md) with Q5 Hotstart High-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) and mumps-specific primers 
4. Gel extraction with QiAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen)
5. [Library preparation](Library\ preparation.md) with Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina)
6. QC with Tapestation and library pooling
