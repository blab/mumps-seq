# mumps-seq
protocols for sequencing mumps viruses

## Overview of Illumina sequencing pipeline for mumps viruses

1. [vRNA extraction] with QiAmp vRNA mini kit (Qiagen)
2. [cDNA synthesis] with Protoscript II First strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB)
3. [PCR] with Q5 Hotstart High-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) and [mumps-specific primers] 
4. [Gel extraction] with QiAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen)
5. [Library preparation] with Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina)
6. QC with Tapestation and library pooling
