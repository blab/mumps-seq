# vRNA extraction 

This protocol follows the published protocol for vRNA extraction with the QiAmp viral RNA mini kit. Because we were extracting vRNA from buccal swabs which may contain host cells, and because we wanted to extract off of the maximum possible amount of material, we preceded the standard protocol with 2 spins. The first pellets host cells so that they can be discarded. The second spin concentrates virions at the bottom of the tube, so that extra supernatant can be discarded, and the sample can be concentrated into the 140 ul necessary for the protocol. All parts of this protocol should be carried out in a clean, pre-PCR hood that has been wiped down with bleach and ethanol before use. Until particle lysis is complete (step 5), there are infectious virions in the sample. All pipette tips and tubes should be discarded and soaked in 10% bleach for 1 hour to sterilize. 

### Concentrate vRNA and remove host cells
1. Thaw 500 ul of buccal swab. Transfer to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. 
2. Centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet host cells. After spin is complete, transfer supernatant to a clean tube and discard tube with pellet. 
3. Centrifuge supernatant for 90 minutes at 4°C at maximum speed (14,000 rpm) to concentrate virions in the lower portion of the supernatant. 

** About 20 minutes before the spin completes, prepare the buffer AVL with carrier RNA. For each sample you are extracting, you will need 0.56 ml of buffer AVL + 5.6 ul of carrier RNA suspended in buffer AVE. The first time you suspend carrier RNA in buffer AVE, aliquot into tubes and store at -20°C to avoid multiple freeze-thaws. 

4. Remove ~300 ul of liquid from the top of the supernatant to leave 140-200 ul of total supernatant. Pipet up and down to resuspend viral pellet. 

### QiAmp viral RNA mini kit protocol 
This protocol is taken directly from the manufacturer's recommended protocol. 

5. Pipet 560 μl of prepared Buffer AVL/carrier RNA mixture into the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing your resuspended virions. If the sample volume is larger than 140 μl, increase the amount of Buffer AVL–carrier RNA proportionally (e.g., a 280 μl sample will require 1120 μl Buffer AVL–carrier RNA) and use a larger tube. 

6. Incubate at room temperature (15–25°C) for 10 min. 
Viral particle lysis is complete after lysis for 10 min at room temperature. Longer incubation times have no effect on the yield or quality of the purified RNA. Potentially infectious agents and RNases are inactivated in Buffer AVL. 

7. Briefly centrifuge the tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid. 

8. Add 560 μl of ethanol (96–100%) to the sample, and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. After mixing, briefly centrifuge the tube to remove drops from inside the lid. 

9. Carefully apply 630 μl of the solution from step 5 to the QIAamp Mini column (in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim. Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Place the QIAamp Mini column into a clean 2 ml collection tube, and discard the tube containing the filtrate. 

10. Carefully open the QIAamp Mini column, and repeat step 6. 
If the sample volume was greater than 140 μl, repeat this step until all of the lysate has been loaded onto the spin column. 

11. Carefully open the QIAamp Mini column, and add 500 μl of Buffer AW1. Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Place the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 2 ml collection tube (provided), and discard the tube containing the filtrate. 
It is not necessary to increase the volume of Buffer AW1 even if the original sample volume was larger than 140 μl. 

12. Carefully open the QIAamp Mini column, and add 500 μl of Buffer AW2. Close the cap and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min. 

13. Place the QIAamp Mini column in a new 2 ml collection tube (not provided), and discard the old collection tube with the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed for 1 min. 

14. Place the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Discard the old collection tube containing the filtrate. Carefully open the QIAamp Mini column and add 30 μl of Buffer AVE equilibrated to room temperature. Close the cap, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min.
